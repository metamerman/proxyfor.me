        <p>proxyfor.me, and indeed democracy in general, is designed around the concept of the &quot;correct
            vote&quot;, the vote each individual would cast if they had the experience, motivation, and time to
            completely investigate an issue. Our current political systems are generally classified as
            &quot;representative democracies&quot; where The People are required to delegate responsibility for the
            vast majority of decisions about the laws and policies that affect us to &quot;representatives&quot;, the
            general theory behind that being that these &quot;representatives&quot; are somehow
            &quot;representative&quot; of us and would therefore make decisions that the same ones we would make if we
            were in their position. That is, what they're supposed to be doing is a kind of averaging over all of our
            &quot;correct votes&quot;.</p>
        <p>But how are they supposed to know how each of us would vote to perform this calculation? And if they don't
            really know what we would do, does that free them to rely on their own predispositions, or worse, are they
            just supposed to do what their political party bosses or their major financial contributors tell them to
            do? We all know the answers to these questions: Not only are the candidates not like us and so are unlikely
            to vote like we would, in most cases we can't even really predict (or control) how they vote at all.</p>
        <p>proxyfor.me works from the opposite direction: Rather than requiring you to thoroughly research and then
            cast a direct vote on each proposal, or even research and then pick &quot;representatives&quot; from a very
            limited set of choices and then trust them to make good decisions for you, in proxyfor.me you provide
            information about yourself that will be used to match you to proxies that have <em>already</em> most likely
            voted like you would if you had the time, experience, and motivation to properly research a proposal. You
            will then have the opportunity to verify this automatically-calculated vote by examining the justifications
            for those votes provided by your proxies. If you agree with their reasoning, or if you have learned that
            you can trust the system's proxy-matching ability and so don't even check up on them, this proxy vote will
            be recorded on your behalf. If you don't agree, you can cast a direct vote to override your proxies.</p>
        <p> proxyfor.me therefore combines the best features of direct and representative democracies: It provides
            total control over your vote of the former in the rare cases when that is needed while leveraging the
            &quot;expertise&quot; and enormous individual labor savings of the latter to handle more routine operation.
            It is crowd-sourced government, another form of Indirect Democracy, but is most accurately described as
            Democracy by Matched Proxy.</p>
        <p>When "auto-advance" is on (check the status line at the top of the screen), voting on the current proposal
            will happen each weekend. The proxy batch calculation runs every Friday at midnight UTC (4pm US Pacific
            time). After the proxy votes are calculated everyone who hasn't cast a direct vote will get an email or
            text message telling them what vote has been calculated for them based on votes of the 5 proxies who are
            most similar to them. They'll then have the weekend to look at how the proxy candidates voted and why, and
            to override the calculated vote if they disagree with it. Voting closes Sunday at midnight UTC and an
            email/text will sent to all direct and proxy voters with the final tally and announcement of the next
            weekend's proposal(s).</p>
        <p>If you have the time and inclination to do the research and consideration necessary to cast a direct vote
            and want to make yourself available as a proxy to other voters you'll have at least 10 days on each
            proposal to do so: The next proposal is locked into the queue every Monday the week prior to the General
            Vote. You'll have access to the information in the proposal and to comments provided by any proxies who
            have voted before you, but you must be sure to vote carefully: Other voters will be relying on your
            decision and once it has used to calculate a proxy vote, changing your vote won't affect any proxy votes
            that relied on it.</p>

    <tab tabTitle="Getting Started">
        <p></p>
        <p>After creating an account, you'll need to fill out the information the proxy matcher will use to match you
            with voters who will most likely vote like you would. There are 2 sets of questions for that, one
            concerning your general personality characteristics, the other on your perceptions of how the political
            world currently works. Filling out the minimum set of these (the Mini Match) only takes about a minute, the
            Full Match about 10 minutes. Note that you can always come back and change your answers or fill out the
            full profile at a later date.</p>
        <p>Next, please fill out the information in the Locality tab. If you live in the state of Colorado please
            authenticate your account using the <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/voter/pages/pub/olvr/findVoterReg.xhtml"
                target="_blank">
                state's on-line voter registration system</a>, so that we can test the
            operation of the authentication system. Note that only a limited subset of the registered voter database is
            stored on this server (just the id, city, and street number for each voter): There is no chance that
            hackers will get any usable quantity of your personal information from this site. Also note that no
            information that links your screen name to any of this information is ever stored on the server, so there
            is no chance that hackers (or even governments) will ever be able to match your personal information to
            anything you do on this
            site.</p>
        <p>Next, if you're so inclined, feel free to vote on any of the available proposals, keeping in mind that the
            proxyfor.me philosophy and design is &quot;quality over quantity&quot;: If you don't have the time or
            motivation to thoroughly investigate an issue (reading most or all of the posts and the background
            information they link to) we'll all be better off if you defer to your proxies, who presumably will have
            that time and motivation. Residents of Boulder and Denver have an extra incentive to do the research,
            though: Most of the proposals in this round of testing came from those jurisdictions and so are things that
            will affect you directly. The votes and most-cited posts will be forwared to these city councils, providing
            active feedback in a more influential form than when people contact them as individuals (see the FAQ for
            more on this).</p>
        <p>If you'd like to debate the proposals, please feel free to do so on any social media site. Be sure to link
            back to proxyfor.me so that your friends and foes can vote too once they've made up their minds. If you
            don't currently use social media or want to use a site more oriented toward public policy decisions, please

    <tab tabTitle="FAQ">
        <p></p>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 1 ? show = 0 : show = 1">Can anyone use this system?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 1">
            <p>Yes! In particular your participation here is not dependent on your age and citizenship status. Even if
                you only have time to create an account and fill out the profile information, it's better to have you
                than not: The mere existence of your profile will have a beneficial stabilizing effect on the operation
                of the system, ensuring that the decisions it renders truly reflect The Will of The People. Note,
                however, that the authentication system validates based on voter registration: Being registered to vote
                in a particular jurisdiction will matter in the finally tally for proposals from that city. In this run
                the city councils probably won't pay attention to votes cast by people who aren't registered voters,
                although it may be of some interest, particularly if it differs from how registered voters vote. But
                there are some proposals that are of more general nature, applicable to <em>all</em> public policy
                decisionmakers.</p>
        </div>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 2 ? show = 0 : show = 2">Why should I bother? Is what I do here binding on anyone?</a>
        </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 2">
            <p>The primary purpose of this round is obviously public beta testing to make sure the system in fact
                works. But a summary of the votes and most influencial posts will be sent to the relevant city councils
                and so could, and we believe eventually will, prove to be very influential in their decisionmaking. We
                therefore believe that participating here is a better use of your time than sending emails to council,
                attending their sessions (or even speaking at them), writing letters to the local papers, etc. because
                representatives routinely ignore citizen input provide those ways for a variety of reasons: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bias: People that participate using these other methods invariably have an ax to grind. Their
                    positions therefore differ from those of "The People" as a whole, making it reasonable to
                    discount them.</li>
                <li>No authentication: No checks are ever done to ensure that people providing feedback even <em>are</em>
                    citizens of the jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>Brigading: Recruitment, particularly recruitment using techniques like fear-mongering, result
                    in much higher participation rates and biased opinions than what comes from people
                    acting on their own.</li>
                <li>No organization: Input comes from a variety of sources at a variety of times, making it very
                    difficult for representatives to accurately discern "The Will Of The People".</li>
                <li>Low signal to noise ratio: People use these forums to rant about things that aren't even under
                    the represenative's control, or to make completely unreasonable suggestions or demands. They
                    also frequently throw in a lot of extraneous information, sometimes to the point that it's not
                    even clear what their vote on a particular proposal would be.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The votes aggregated here and provided to them as a digest suffer from none of these issues and will
                therefore likely be the best source of information representatives have about The Will Of The
                People. Of course this assumes they even care about that: See the questions below for the long-term
                answer to this one.</p>
        </div>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 3 ? show = 0 : show = 3">Should I use my real name as my screen name when creating an
                account?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 3">
            <p>Please don't: It's not necessary and choosing a new screen name not only helps protect you against
                coercion or exploitation, it also protects the rest of us from you having an outsized influence (e.g.,
                many people would vote the way Kim Kardashian recommends, but is that really a good design?) Your
                reputation in proxyfor.me will be determined by the quality of your votes and posts and the credentials
                you acquire here, not by who you are in the real world. Or on other social media, for that matter, so
                you should also not use the same screen name here as you do there either. No identifying demographic
                information is required to sign up or use the system, and the authentication process is completely
                independent of the exact form of your screen name. </p>
        </div>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 5 ? show = 0 : show = 5">What makes you think you can predict my vote?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 5">
            <p>First a question for you: What percentage of the time do your current representatives (city council,
                county commissioners, state or national legislature (congress and senate)) vote like you would if you
                were in their position? proxyfor.me only has to be noticeably better than that to make it a legitimate
                upgrade to our existing representative democracies, a low hurdle indeed!</p>
            <p>As for how much better it will be, while there has been very little research in this area (predicting
                votes on specific laws/polices using only personality characteristics) there is extensive research in
                the domains of political science and psychology that shows that personality and political preferences
                (your contribution to "The Will Of The People") have a large impact on policy preferences. This system
                just applies that research, and the instruments they use to do the science. The particular set of
                inventory items this system currently uses is not cast in concrete: If additional items are shown to be
                more predictive of voting behavior, they'll be incorporated into the personality assessment. More
                likely, though, is that the current inventory will do a good job but is much larger than necessary and
                that most of the items will turn out not to be useful for predicting voting behavior. Those items can
                be eliminated in future versions to save those who join later a little time in setting up their
                accounts.</p>
            <p>Our best estimates of correlations for votes on proposals (initiatives/referrendums) are as follows
                based on published reports and our own modeling. For frame of reference, two people who vote exactly
                opposite of each other on each proposal will have a correlation of -1. Voting exactly the same on every
                issue would give a correlation of 1. If each votes randomly, correlation will be 0:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                <li>0.3 voters chosen at random</li>
                <li>0.4 voters to the representatives they voted for</li>
                <li>0.5 voters of a given political party chosen at random</li>
                <li>0.6 voter-chosen delegates (Liquid Democracy)</li>
                <li>0.8 Mini-Match in proxyfor.me</li>
                <li>0.9+ Full-Match in proxyfor.me</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some observations on the above:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Correlation between voters chosen at random is non-zero because most initiatives/referrendums pass
                    or fail by supermajorities (making them very unlike most elections for representatives, most of
                    which are decided by very small margins).</li>
                <li>Correlation between voters within a political party are actually higher than between voters and
                    their chosen "representatives" due to things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling"
                        target="_blank">logrolling</a>
                    and corruption (whether that be overt, or in the form of indirect incentives like campaign
                    contributions).</li>
                <li>Correlations for even Mini-Match are higher than almost all political science research ever finds,
                    mostly because the vast majority of political science research uses incredibly crude measures for
                    this, most commonly consisting of a single item: "Rate your political orientation on a scale from 1
                    to 7, where 1 is very conservative and 7 is very progressive"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note that although personality and political preferences are generally fairly stable over a person's
                lifetime, some life experiences can cause them to shift. For example, the experience of being mugged
                generally results in increased sensitivity to danger and increased desire for government interventions
                that might increase safety. Perhaps not coincidentally having a child can have the same effects. But,
                again, rather than ask you if you've been a victim of a violent crime or had a child and match you to
                others who have had similar experiences, it's better to just ask you to update your personality profile
                a few months after any significant life events. Your integration of those experiences will be reflected
                in the updated profile and therefore in the proxies the system will select for you. If life is smooth
                sailing for you, plan on updating your profile every 5 years or so.</p>
        </div>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 6 ? show = 0 : show = 6">How is the proxy matching done?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 6">
            <p>The match is currently an unweighted least squares fit to each of the items in the personality profile
                of all voters who have cast a direct vote on a proposal. Eventually, after enough people join the
                system, the fit will include the locality information (this will improve legitimacy, but may also
                capture cultural factors not completely accounted for by the personality profile). The match is done in
                real time in the app, and as a batch job in the Friday-night proxy calculation. The automatically-cast
                proxy vote is locked in after the batch calculation is done (i.e., your vote will be what the email
                tells you it will be, regardless of any direct votes are cast after the notifications are sent out),
                but the app and web site will continue to provide real-time updated proxy calculations to assist you in
                casting a &quot;correct vote&quot; if you decide to override your proxies.</p>
            <p>The first section in the profile is a &quot;Big Five&quot; personality profile, the most widely used and
                validated assessment of personality used by psychologists (in the scientific literature it is sometimes
                called the Big Five Inventory (BFI) or the Five Factor Model (FFM)). The second section concerns
                perceptions of power and issue priorities and so is more similar to the ideological inventories used in
                the fields of political science and political economy, although it is more complete than most of those.
                Note that nothing in this system is designed to make any claims about <em>why</em> people vote the way
                they do: It's sufficient to match proxy voters to direct voters based on their
                psychological/ideological similarity so long as that match can be shown to have a correlation to their
                actual voting behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 7 ? show = 0 : show = 7">Is this some sort of AI system?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 7">
            <p>There is some similarity, but also a very important difference. The similarity is that the front end of
                both types of systems is pattern matching. The difference is that AI system generally have a learning
                component where the pattern matching is updated when an incorrect match is made whereas the proxyfor.me
                pattern matching system is fixed. While adding a learning component would undoubtedly improve
                performance, doing so would bring with it an insurmountable problem: There'd be no practical way for
                outsiders to verify the operation of the system because the matches made would vary depending on a
                weight matrix that would be continuously changing. The pattern matching in proxyfor.me will be updated
                in future versions based on statistical analysis, but the updates will consist of changing the
                information input into the pattern match (the set of questions) rather than continuously adjusting the
                weight assigned to each question like a machine learning system would.</p>
            <p>A more appropriate comparison is with the Multivac computer in Isaac Asimov's short story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_(short_story)"
                    target="_blank">Franchise</a>, although this system performs the much more difficult (and much more
                useful) job of predicting The People's votes on individual proposals, rather than just who they would
                vote for to be dictator (see next question).</p>
        </div>
        <h5> <a (click)="show === 8 ? show = 0 : show = 8">Why can't I choose my own delegates?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 8">
            <p>Because you're not competent to do that. Seriously: Any claim that you are has got to rank up there with
                the idea that the sun goes around the earth or that disease is caused by &quot;evil spirits&quot; in
                terms of its total lack of any scientific justification.  There are a wide variety of examples, both
                anecdotal and in the scientific literature, that show that people invariably use inappropriate decision
                criteria when choosing representatives. Instead of actually evaluating whether their chosen
                representative will cast &quot;correct votes&quot; for them, they use spurious characteristics like
                physical appearance, name familiarity, alleged experience or expertise in some area, demographic
                information (race, gender, age, etc.) or whether the candidate is &quot;someone you'd like to have a
                beer with&quot;. Of course the most egregious example of this is the fact that 88% of German voters
                approved Hitler as dictator in the 1934 referendum, a fact from which one can only conclude one of two
                things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>People are just stupid and can't be trusted to make rational decisions about anything.</li>
                <li>There's something about choosing appropriate representatives that is intrinsically extremely
                    difficult or maybe even impossible and so this is not a reasonable requirement on which to build a
                    public policy decisionmaking system. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>proxyfor.me is founded on the second theory and so instead of allowing you to choose your own
                representatives, the system will use math and science to do it for you. Even better: Rather than
                limiting you to just one or a few representatives (as other systems do) proxyfor.me will always give
                you 5 <em>and</em> will automatically redo the matching for every single vote. The latter feature also
                gets around the fatal flaws discovered in &quot;Liquid Democracy&quot; systems that rely on fixed
                delegate selection, which, as it turns out, don't work because:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Few people actually use that feature: only 15% in the case of the German LiquidFeedback system as
                    used by the Pirate Party as described in Kling et al. (available as <a href="http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf"
                        target="_blank">http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf)</a>). And the very
                    people who do set this up are the very people most likely to cast a direct vote and so they don't
                    actually benefit from it (only 3% of votes in that study were cast through delegates).</li>
                <li>The people who do use it pick inappropriate delegates (i.e., there is a low correlation between the
                    direct voting record of an individual and the delegates they choose).</li>
                <li>When your delegate doesn't vote you don't vote either and so your preferences are simply not
                    reflected in the final decision.</li>
                <li>Transitive voting (redelegation) which was designed to partially fix problem #3 makes problem #2
                    significantly worse, though most of the time it just has no effect at all because people chosen as
                    delegates haven't chosen their own delegates (problem #1)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A dead giveaway that a proponent of Liquid Democracy or even of conventional representative democracy is
                laboring under a fundamental misconception of the way political decisionmaking actually works is when
                you see them make some claim about wanting to delegate to capture &quot;expertise&quot;. There is an
                almost trivial rebuttal to these claims: Just ask them &quot;Who is the foremost expert on the morality
                of abortion in the world today?&quot; That would be the Pope, right? So that means we should all
                delegate our votes on this issue to the Pope? Of course not and the reason is completely obvious:
                Expertise is only a small component of the process of determining what a &quot;correct vote&quot; for
                you would be. Far more important are your personality characteristics and political preferences, which
                is something that average voters cannot adequately assess in delegates (let alone those dissembling
                political candidates) even if they had access to the raw data (which in most cases they don't).</p>
            <p>This system also addresses a second fundamental flaw in representative democracy: Because there is so
                much difference between individuals it's actually impossible to find a single representative that will
                vote like you would on a majority of issues. Worse, this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the
                range of personality types reflected in the candidates for public office is extremely limited, making
                it even more unlikely that you'll find a quality representative unless you yourself are an elected
                official and so share many or most of those characteristics. </p>

        <h5> <a (click)="show === 9 ? show = 0 : show = 9">Won't people just game the system by faking their
                personality profile?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 9">
            <p>There are two reasons why that won't work. First, by faking your personality profile you're essentially
                abandoning &quot;your people&quot;, the people who would most likely be able to use your vote in their
                proxy matches. That means they'll be matched to people more different from them, which may mean a
                &quot;correct vote&quot; won't end up being recorded for them. Because there will generally be many
                more proxy votes than direct votes, you may end up <em>reducing</em> the chance that the overall vote
                will go your way by attempting this. Secondly, as an individual you're unlikely to have any effect on
                proxy matches anyway because you'd need at least three fake votes near the psychological/ideological
                territory you're trying to claim to have any assurance that your vote won't just get ignored.</p>
            <p>Now it is theoretically possible for <em>groups</em> of people to influence the operation by staking out
                territories that analysis has shown to be composed of voters who are &quot;on the fence&quot; and where
                the direct voters matched to them will have voted with a 3/2 split. It'll be hard to get away with this
                too, for two reasons. Firstly, because the voting results are not released until voting has closed,
                it'd be pretty difficult to predict exactly where the &quot;vulnerable&quot; areas will be. Secondly,
                it'd be very difficult to organize an effort like this without the project being exposed, at which
                point The People will mostly likely punish the instigators by collectively voting against them,
                ensuring the outcome will be the <em>opposite</em> of what they had intended.</p>
            <p>Even so, if post-vote analysis shows that this has become a problem (it will be very easy to detect
                because the votes and posts will show up as outliers in a statistical analysis), there are many ways to
                make it harder to pull off. For example, because the inflection points will be different for each
                proposal, the system might restrict how often one can change one's profile (or by how much). The system
                could potentially even <em>compute</em> the personality profile by examining an individual's voting
                record (i.e., once you have cast enough direct votes it becomes possible to perform an inverse of the
                proxy-matching calculation).</p>

        <h5> <a (click)="show === 10 ? show = 0 : show = 10">Why aren't demographics (age, gender, race) being used?</a>
        </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 10">
            <p>As it turns out, those are relatively poor predictors of political behavior. For example, while it's
                generally true that people become more conservative as they get older, it would be a mistake to use age
                as a matching item: While the average 70-year-old might be more conservative than they were at the age
                of 25, they're still far more likely to vote like a moderate 25-year-old than a conservative
                70-year-old. Using race, gender, income, education, or life experience as matching criteria have
                similar problems: They are at best indirect correlates of the underlying personality characteristics.
                Why not use the direct measures rather than those intermediaries? </p>
            <p>Secondly, people are reluctant to provide certain kinds of information, which degrades the quality of
                matches in general because any algorithm that depends on them will tend to match people on whether or
                not they provide it rather than on the measures themselves: While being willing to publicly divulge
                your income probably does tell us something about your personality, we don't have any evidence that
                other people who are willing to do that will vote like you do.</p>

        <h5> <a (click)="show === 11 ? show = 0 : show = 11">What, no secret ballot?</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 11">
            <p>Research has shown that this isn't necessary and indeed providing this ability may <em>lower</em> the
                quality of decisions because it is typically the least informed voters who insist on a secret ballot.
                Public voting is also required to support a proxy system and to ensure the reliability of the system.
                See the Matchism manifesto for more on this, including references (<a href="http://www.matchism.org/system"
                    target="_blank">http://www.matchism.org/system</a>).</p>
            <p>As for claims that public voting will result in people refusing to vote for fear of reprisal or being
                coerced into voting particular ways by threats or financial incentives, as it turns out believing that
                these things will have a significant (or even measurable) impact on outcomes has about as much
                scientific validity as belief in Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. And that's mostly the result of
                research done prior to the existence of social media: Imagine what will happen if some
                individual/corporation/church/etc. attempts to buy votes or coerce members of an organization into
                voting a particular way and someone posts about it on Twitter or FaceBook (which of course is
                inevitable: No effort large enough to influence the outcome of a vote could possibly remain a secret).
                The backlash against the position of that organization would be swift and ruthless: Detecting and
                punishing this sort of behavior (the technical term for it is &quot;altruistic punishment&quot;) is
                something that human beings have evolved to become extremely diligent about and this system doesn't
                even need to have any built-in support for this &quot;feature&quot; of human programming to ensure that
                it will get activated. If anything we might need a systematic way to prevent <em>false</em> accusations
                from having an influence on the voting, the potential for misdirected backlash being far more likely to
                be a problem than any actual attempts to coerce voting will be.</p>
            <p>If you are concerned about any consequences from having <em>your</em> vote made public please send your
                story (via an anonymous remailer if you prefer) to gm@proxyfor.me so that we can take your concerns
                into account in future designs of this system. Also remember that you can always abstain or have your
                vote computed for you based on your matched proxies, either of which should greatly reduce any risk
                associated with participation. You also have your screen name to protect you: If you reveal the screen
                name/real world identity information to anyone else (e.g., to facilitate taking a bribe from them or to
                submit yourself to coercion from them), you have only yourself to blame if that information is later
                used against you. If your concern is for how this system might affect others (and not you personally),
                it'd be best to wait and see if those others really agree that there is a problem here before we go off
                and hobble the system in an effort to prevent a problem that is most likely only theoretical.</p>

        <div *ngIf="show === 12">
            <p>In most countries, including the US, the voter rolls are public information. The simplest way to use
                this information to authentic users is to have each user of this system claim their name off of those
                lists. To keep the system size manageable for this round of testing we're only authenticating residents
                of Colorado. While some similar decisionmaking systems have obsessed about security and require much
                more complicated forms of authentication (requiring a credit card, sending a postcard to the registered
                address that the user must respond to, etc.) this is almost certainly overkill and actively inhibits
                the adoption of the new system: Just as voter fraud is extremely rare in representative democracies
                it's very unlikely that the collective decision on any specific proposal in proxyfor.me will be decided
                by fraudulent voters. Even so, it will eventually be necessary to do a real-world validation, probably
                by mailing a postcard to all registered voters asking them to confirm their registration. We'll do that
                when the system gains enough users that the governments it is shadowing start to take the decisions and
                posts made here into account in their decisionmaking. Mean time, the system does take the usual
                security precautions (such as recording timestamps, IP addresses, and machine fingerprints, see the
                source code for details) to
                ensure that any systematic attempts to cast fraudulent votes can be detected. Any attempt to
                authenticate as someone else will be reported to the approriate authorities (it's not voter fraud (yet)
                but it's still identity theft). </p>

                &quot;brigading&quot;, where a small faction of like-minded individuals can disrupt the system by all
                casting the same vote soon after a proposal becomes available. To prevent this from working to
                discourage voters from even investigating a proposal because it may be misperceived as a &quot;lost
                cause&quot;, these early votes will be hidden from view until the final vote is tabulated. Ultimately,
                however, brigading in particular is unlikely to have any effect at all in the final outcome: Because
                proxy matches are based on widely varying personality characteristics, a small group of
                ideologically-similar extremist voters will not match up to the much larger numbers of more moderate

                (i.e., toward authoritarian leaders with ever-increasing powers). If we want to transition to an
                improved decisionmaking system, something virtually everyone agrees is necessary (albeit some actually
                <em>prefer</em> the authoritarian alternative), there are only two ways to achieve this: Violent
                revolution, or the path laid out here: Build a better system, run it in parallel with the existing

                replaced by the new one. Note that the executive and judicial branches of government will continue to
                operate as they do now for the most part, also ensuring stability and continuity during the transition.</p>
            <p>At first this new system will primarily be a source of new and oftentimes unconventional proposals and
                The People’s evaluations of them. As the number of people using it grows this system will gradually
                begin to replace slacktivism (petition-oriented) and polling organizations because of the greater
                diversity and consistency of the participation rates of the people here: Everyone effectively votes on
                everything, rather than having the “voting” done by extremists or demographic outliers as is the case
                for slacktivism sites and polling that relies on people answering land-line phones. Politicians will
                increasingly start paying attention to the outcomes when this threshold is reached. Some will submit
                their own proposals to this system instead of the old one to gain preliminary support, and others will
                voluntarily commit to casting votes to reflect the Will of The People as recorded here.</p>
            <p>Another milestone will occur when participation rates approach 25% in some locality, as this is the
                range of popular approval in existing misrepresentative democracies (51% approval when less than 50% of
                those eligible to vote participate). Proxyfor.me will at that point be more legitimate than the
                existing system because of the psychological/ideological breadth of the participants, at least for
                proposals that pass with large supermajorities. Politicians will increasingly call for controversial
                proposals to be voted on here rather than taking the risk of voting on something themselves or waiting
                on the result of a referrendum (a procedure that's not even available in many places).</p>
            <p>When participation rates approach 50% in some locality the dynamic changes again because the new system
                <em>becomes</em> the legitimate decisionmaking system for that locality. At that point it will merely
                be a matter of organizing the transfer of power to the new system and the shutting down of the old one.</p>
            <p>There is one possible exception to this evolutionary process: When a coup/revolution/counter-revolution
                occurs in a locality with a significant participation rate. In that case the new system may be called
                on to take over decisionmaking in a matter of days or weeks rather than years. This system has been
                designed to accommodate this need, but it will still require a leap of faith from the population. It is
                perhaps worth all of us considering what we would do if we found ourselves in this situation: If your
                local/state/national government were to somehow become non-functional, and especially if crucial
                infrastructure (power, Internet service, etc.) is also shut down, would you prefer to transfer control
                to whoever tries to claim authority and fill the power vacuum, or would you maybe prefer to rely on the
                people who are psychologically much more similar to you but who may live in other
                cities/states/countries?</p>

            <p>There is an almost magical aspect to &quot;government&quot;: The legitimate government of a place

                <em>becomes</em> the government of that place. No need for rioting in the streets or beheading of the
                existing leaders, just a quiet transfer of power from the old system to the new one. Unlikely nearly

            <p>To bootstrap about a dozen proposals have been prepared in advance, mostly originating from <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-city-council.html"

                city councils. Eventually the vast majority of proposals will probably come from the executive branch
                of government (city manager/mayor/governor/president), but there will also be an &quot;initiative&quot;
                process which will allow The People to submit their own proposals. A key component of that process will
                be to ensure that we don't waste The People's time with poorly written or legally non-viable proposals,
                or those which only appeal to some extremist fringe of the population and therefore would fail
                spectacularly in a general vote (one or more of these flaws being found in nearly every petition posted

                and in the comments...</a> </h5>
        <div *ngIf="show === 23">
            <p>Not really a question, and actually probably not even an accurate characterization, at least if by
                &quot;liberal&quot; you mean anything similar to the positions espoused by the US Democratic party. But
                there is expected to be a pronounced anti-conservative bias in this system when compared with
                traditional representative democracy, especially as it is practiced in the US. There are two causes for
                that, one short term, one long. The first is that early-adopters of this system, as with all new
                things, will tend to be younger, more educated, and higher in the Big-5 dimension of
                &quot;openness&quot;. All of these are negatively correlated with conservatism. But it's not really the
                same as &quot;liberalism&quot;, at least as espoused by US Democrats because it will actually more
                frequently resemble US libertarianism or classical liberalism as is more commonly found in Europe
                (calls for greater personal freedom, especially with respect to drug use, greater acceptance of
                capitalism, limited government, etc.) all of which contradict core positions of the US Democratic
                party. The best response to this short-term bias is to actively recruit your conservative friends and
                family members to join. Remember, they don't even have to cast direct votes, the mere existence of
                their profile will ensure that they're being represented in the final decisions.</p>
            <p>The second reason, however, will cause the system to skew anti-conservative even in the long-term and
                with near full participation rates: The fact is that all existing representative democracies have a
                very strong conservative bias. Not only do conservatives have a significantly higher turnout in
                elections (at least partially as a result of high Big-5 Conscientiousness, which is highly correlated
                to conservatism), but voting policies, especially in the US, accentuate this bias by preventing or
                actively discouraging large percentages of the population from voting at all (e.g., burdensome voter ID
                laws, only providing a limited selection of candidates almost all of which share key personality
                characteristics, only offering fixed polling stations that require taking off work to vote and then
                fighting large crowds, and denying felons, legal immigrants, and young people the right to vote). Most
                of these &quot;new&quot; voters will tend to be politically moderate and whose positions are not
                currently represented by existing political parties which tend to emphasize extreme positions on all
                dimensions of political behavior. These &quot;new&quot; participants, most of whom will probably vote
                by proxy, will appear to be &quot;liberal&quot; to conservatives, and yet &quot;conservative&quot; to
                far-left voters. In fact they are neither: They are merely the broad middle of the bell curve: People
                that representative democracies have been failing to represent all of these years.</p>
            <p>Any &quot;bias&quot; in the proposals is designed to capitalize on this: Because the goal is to ensure
                high positive vote differentials, the proposals are being designed to appeal to these moderate voters,
                not to the extremists who traditionally participate in politics. The positions of these extremists will
                therefore be reflected in the numbers (and ferocity) of the pro/con posts, but will have much less
                influence in the final outcomes.</p>

                individuals are free, or even encouraged, to manually cross post, there can never be any doubt raised
                in the minds of The People that proxyfor.me is a fully independent decisionmaking system and that it
                has been designed solely as a tool to be used by them to set public policy. Using it for anything else,
                or tying it to any system that is not specifically designed to facilitate achieving that goal, is an
                unacceptable security risk as well as being a distraction and delegitimization of the founding

            <p>The budgeting system is still in development, but will work fundamentally like the proposal system: The
                budgets will be prepared by the executive branch of government (using existing budgets as starting
                point), and those who have the time to thoroughly investigate an issue will participate directly
                whereas most people will participate through personality/ideologically matched proxies. The difference
                in the budgeting system is that instead of casting a yes/no vote, direct participants will have the
                opportunity to make line-item changes (changing amounts and/or priorities) for both expenditures and
                tax rates. The proxy votes will be calculated to be an aggregation of the changes proposed by the
                direct participants.</p>

                understanding them for non-English speakers will be to use translation software (such as <a href="https://translate.google.com/"

                translation software is advised for now. </p>

                Please let them speak: If you disagree with their ideas or their methods, the proper way to deal with
                this is to ignore them and block them from matching to you (reducing the influence of their direct
                vote), not to attempt to silence them. Please don't flag profanity, obscenity, personal attacks or
                anything else that you might find upsetting or offensive <em>unless</em> the post is <em>also</em> off
                topic. Posts you flag will be reviewed by moderators and if they truly don't have anything to do with
                the proposal, they will be deleted. Repeated off-topic posting will result in posting privileges being
                revoked (although voting rights themselves will remain intact). But note too that filing more than one

        <p>For those who want to validate the operation of the system, the full source for both the client and server
            components of proxyfor.me are available on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/metamerman/proxyfor.me"
                target="_blank">https://github.com/metamerman/proxyfor.me</a>. This is an open source project and is
            distributed under a very permissive license to ensure that anyone who wants to can verify correct operation
            or produce derivative systems to test new ideas. Contributions are welcome! </p>
        <p>The results of each decision are produced automatically as the closing emails are being sent out and stored
            in the "results" directory. There are three files for each closed proposal: proposal.json, directvotes.txt,
            and proxyvotes.txt. The latter two are tab-delimited files containing a timestamp, screen name, vote, and
            the two sets of matching data. For example, the direct votes for proposal JMR-1v0 are stored in the file:
            https://www.proxyfor.me/results/JMR-1v0/directvotes.txt</p>
        <p>You can use these files to verify that the correct vote was recorded for you, or with a little programming
            using the matching algorithm included in the source code, even that all the proxy matches were done
            correctly.</p>

        <p>This Single Page Application (SPA) was developed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB NoSQL database, Express web
            server, Angular UI framework, and Node.js server-side JavaScript environment. It's written in TypeScript (a
            JavaScript superset that includes support for types and classes) which is translated to JavaScript at build
            time (no TypeScript is run on the browser). It's designed to be portable as apps for iOS and Android, but
            development on these platforms hasn't started yet (any volunteers?)</p>
        <p>As a beta test of the first release, relatively little effort has been expended on aesthetics: While
            suggestions are welcome, at this point the primary emphasis should be on how it works, not how it looks.
            There is also a lot of optimization remaining to be done (load times should significantly decrease when
            that's all done).</p>
        <p>The system is currently being hosted on Amazon's AWS, but it has been designed to be portable to other cloud
            or dedicated server platforms. Besides just paying for more cloud resources, a wide variety of upgrades and
            optimizations are available which will ensure that the system can grow to accommodate however many people
            sign up (up to billions!), although at some point external funding (probably crowdfunding) will be
            necessary to continue to grow.</p>
        <p>Beta 2 introduced miniprofiles (matches can be made with the most predictive 6 items in the full profile).</p>
        <p>Beta 3 updated to current versions of Angular (6) and associated development tools which allowed fixing
            bookmarking and several other issues.</p>
        <p>Beta 4 added authentication for Colorado voters and new proposals based on Boulder and Denver city council
            votes.</p>
